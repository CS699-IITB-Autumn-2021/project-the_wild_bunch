Back when the first generation iPad Pro was released, I was excited about the prospect of a slim tablet replacing my rather bulky work laptop. In about a year that I used it, I tried to overlook its flaws for the benefits, but software wise, tablets just weren’t ready to replace a full-scale desktop OS. Since then, a lot has changed – the world has seen a pandemic, Cristiano Ronaldo has returned to Manchester United, and I have come to realise that my perspective towards tablets might have been skewered. The latter, in large part, has happened in the past two weeks, thanks to the Apple iPad Mini 6, or iPad Mini 2021 – whatever you’d like to call it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe iPad Mini 6 is a balance of screen size, form factor and portability, an important formula that frequent travellers would prioritise once the pandemic recedes. It has also made me realise that the purpose of a tablet is not just to replace a laptop, but fill its absence. Before you jump to conclusions, I also believe that Apple should have made a keyboard for the iPad Mini 6 to fill the laptop’s absence better, but once you start spending time with it, you’d realise that this does you more good than bad. Here’s why.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFORM FACTOR AND PORTABILITY: ALMOST POCKETABLE\r\nTo state that the iPad Mini 6 is compact is to state the obvious – it is, after all, from the ‘Mini’ family of Apple’s hardware. You get an 8.3-inch display on a tablet that is 7.7 inches in height, and 5.3 inches in width. It is also 6.3mm thick, and weighs 297 grams for the cellular version, which is what we have with us. In comparison, the new Apple iPhone 13 Pro is 7.7mm thick and weighs 205 grams. The latter feels heavier in-hand because on the iPad, the weight is not proportionately higher, and is better distributed too.\r\nAll of this makes the iPad Mini 6 one of the easiest to carry, and you can stow it anywhere in your bag without worrying. It is easy to grip and operate with one hand, especially with an Apple Smart Folio cover slapped on. On desks, the iPad Mini 6 is a good second display to add to compact laptops without it taking up a lot of space, helping you to avoid switching between windows and tabs constantly, when writing. This actually helps reduce distractions, and its compact footprint means it’s great for small or loaded desks.\r\n', 15, 1, '', '', '', 1, '2021-10-18'),

Under this, a unique digital health ID will be provided to the people, which will contain all the health records of the person,\" Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had tweeted on Thursday. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe ID will be created using an Aadhar Card or the beneficiary’s mobile number, and will serve as an identifier to pull relevant health records.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA government official involved in the making of NDHM said the PM-DHM will act as a “one-stop solution” for all healthcare needs of the common man. It aims to develop the necessary backbone to support an integrated digital health infrastructure in the country.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe mission will create electronic medical records (EMR) for each individual, according to the NDHM’s website, which will allow doctors to track data over time, easily identify which patients are due for preventive screenings or checkups, check how their patients are doing on certain parameters (such as blood pressure readings) and monitor and improve overall quality of care within the practice.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe project was first launched in pilot phase in the Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“This kind of digital communication will render cost effective services through access to large pool of clinicians and will help generate relevant data for health policy makers not only in modern medicine, preventive medicine, traditional system of medicines and Yoga for more inclusive healthcare system through interventions like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML),” Dr. RS Sharma, CEO, National Health Authority, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had said earlier.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>How Will a Unique Health ID Work?</h4>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scheme consists of four essential blocks — unique digital health ID, healthcare professionals registry, health facility registry and electronic health records.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe first objective of the scheme is to create a digital environment for healthcare via these four blocks. At a later stage, the government plans to integrate telemedicine and e-pharmacies.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA unique health ID, according to the government, is important to standardise the process of identification of an individual across healthcare providers. “The Health ID will be used for the purposes of uniquely identifying persons, authenticating them, and threading their health records (only with the informed consent of the patient) across multiple systems and stakeholders.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo generate ID, the system will collect certain basic details including demographic and location, family/relationship, and contact details.\r\n<br><br>\r\nApart from bringing doctors, the government will also create a comprehensive repository of all healthcare professionals working across both modern and traditional systems of medicine. It will also create a comprehensive repository of health facilities across India, including different systems of medicine.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“It includes both public and private health facilities including hospitals, clinics, diagnostic laboratories and imaging centers, pharmacies, etc.” \r\n<br><br>\r\n<h4>How Will Health Records be Created? </h4>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first step, a health ID will be created after which health information from an individual will be taken. This information will then be linked to the health ID, after taking the consent from those individuals. The information termed as ‘Personal Health Record-System (PHR)’ will enable an individual to manage information about his or her healthcare, according to the NDHM’s website. This includes viewing of a longitudinal record, consisting of all health data, lab reports, treatment details, discharge summaries across one or multiple health facilities.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe mission will create ‘Electronic medical record (EMR)’ which, as explained by the government, is a digital version of a patient’s chart. It contains the patient’s medical and treatment history. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAccording to Sharma, EMR can be accessed by various systems and enable domain specific registries through the unified health interface (UHI) very similar to the unified payment interface (UPI).\r\n<br><br>\r\n“UHI is poised to make the healthcare service delivery landscape more competitive, reliable and accessible. We have a ubiquitous network of 120 crore telephone connections, 70 crore internet connections and 60 crore mobile subscribers,” Sharma had said earlier while adding, “We have data prices which are the lowest in the world and the consumption pattern is also 12 GB per month per person which is very huge.”', 23, 2, '', '', '', 1, '2021-10-18'),

KKR, were involved in two of these three matches, and compelled to take the more tortuous route having finished fourth in the points table in the league stage. This only enhances their amazing story.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the first phase of the season played in India, KKR finished at 7th place, losing 5 out of seven matches. When the tournament resumed in the UAE, KKR were a team transformed, winning 5 out of seven matches much to everyone’s astonishment, and leapfrogged into the play-offs.\r\nTwo gripping contests, both providing edge of the seat excitement, saw KKR progress into the final. In the eliminator, they beat Royal Challengers Bangalore and in the second qualifier on Wednesday, Eoin Morgan’s team pulled off a sensational last-over win over Delhi Capitals.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are very few examples of any team tracing such an amazing trajectory in a season. KKR’s performances in the first and second phase as different as chalk and cheese, from utter mediocrity to excellence, raising queries as to how the same bunch of players could have played in such contrasting fashion within a few months.\r\n<br><br>\r\nClearly, the difference was not in the skills of the players, rather their mindset. In the first phase, KKR appeared listless, almost defeatist. Close matches were surrendered without a fight. It was almost as if the team accepted defeat as soon as it took the field. With low mental resolve, the body language of players too was negative, which in turn led to diminished trust in their own abilities, rise in mistakes and errors and consequently defeats.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore the second phase started, chief coach Brendon McCullum spoke that he and captain Morgan had spent time deliberating these aspects with the players, and the KKR team that would be seen in action in UAE would be a departure from the one in India. The target was to play with tempered aggression, a positive approach stemming from self-belief. This mantra worked brilliantly.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMind you KKR were not at full strength in this phase. Pace ace Pat Cummins had skipped the second half of the tournament, Andre Russell spent almost half the time in the dug out because of injury. These were two key overseas players, but their unavailability was hardly felt.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere was also a question mark lingering over Sunil Narine, who has had to revise his action once again, and was also left out from the West Indies T20 World Cup squad. Narine had been integral to KKR’s prospects in previous seasons. Would he be able to cope technically and mentally this time too?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen there was issue of the malfunctioning top order in the first phase. What could be done to improve this as there was very little back up strength available? Apart from Morgan, the important overseas recruits were all bowlers and allrounders: Narine, Russell, Shakib Al Hasan, Lockie Ferguson.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnswers to these and other compunctions came in every match that KKR played in the second phase. There was both tenacity, flair and consistency in their performances. When matches got tight, the team regrouped swiftly, some player or the other putting his hand up to win the situation There were superb individual displays, like Narine in the eliminator against RCB where he picked up four priceless wickets and smashed 26 invaluable runs. Or a great show of nerves, like Rahul Tripathi hitting Ravichandran Ashwin for a six to seal a place in the final.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe biggest decision taken by the team management, and which ended up paying the richest dividends, was pitching debutant Venkatesh Iyer as opener. A swashbuckling left-hander, Iyer was a revelation in the tournament, not too far behind KL Rahul and Ruturaj Gaikwad as opener. Iyer also showed bowling skills and his controlled medium-pace was of high value.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe only failure was Morgan who is going through a dreadful lean trot, the sequence of scores reading like a telephone number. Suggestions that he should have dropped himself in the play-offs were laughable. As captain, Morgan was astute, demanding, understanding, inspiring, and got the best out of his players, which made him invaluable.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI have dealt with at length about KKR because their campaign in this tournament was so extraordinary. They are on the cusp of a memorable win, but that won’t come on a platter because CSK, barring a minor slump towards the end of the league phase, have been playing terrific cricket too, finding ways and means to win through crises, batsmen or bowlers rising to the occasion with special performances.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCSK’s legacy in the IPL is magnificent, which adds to the pressure on players, many of whom are on the wrong side of 30. Led by the iconic MS Dhoni, these players have sustained form, fitness and focus for a protracted period of time, which is not just admirable, but also the biggest threat for KKR in the final; though on lead in form, the Kolkata side looks more rounded.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn batting, CSK’s top order has been wobbly, apart from openers Gaikwad and Faf du Plessis, who’ve been outstanding. Uthappa played a sparkling knock in the qualifier, but runs have been hard to come by for others in the middle order, Moeen Ali, Suresh Raina and even Dhoni till his spectacular late assault against DC which saw CSK through.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKKR bowlers, especially Shakib, Narine and Varun Chakravarthy pose a serious threat to the CSK batting. In two previous matches, this troika of spinners has conceded just 65 and 80 runs collectively in 12 overs each game, and also picked up a bagful of wickets, strangling opponents at the start, in the middle and in the death overs. Ferguson and Shivam Mavi have been accurate and incisive too, though the spotlight on them hasn’t been much.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite the iffy form in batting and bowling, the fact that CSK are in the final shows ambition, mental toughness and ability to withstand pressure. To sustain form, fitness and motivation for a protracted period of time demands stringent physical and mental conditioning. For sheer self-belief, there is perhaps no better side than CSK, who have been champions thrice and in an IPL final for the 9th time, a simple stat that speaks volumes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKKR have been twice winners of the title, the last time way back in 2014. They’ve come back from the brink this season and are one step away from charting the finest turnaround story in the IPL.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt promises to be a heck of a match!', 151, 2, '', '', '', 1, '2021-10-18'),

He was shot dead on July 10, 2002. Consequently, an FIR was filed on charges of murder and criminal conspiracy at the Thanesar police station and on November 10, 2003, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered a CBI investigation in the case, the Indian Express said in a report.

The letter’s contents accused him of sexually exploiting women Dera followers (sadhvis), and it was highlighted in a news report by Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. Then, on the night of 24 October the same year, two men riding a motorcycle shot Chhatrapati at point-blank range outside his residence. The journalist succumbed to his injuries four weeks later and the Dera chief was convicted for his role in the murder on 11 January 2019 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the case by Special CBI Court on 17 January 2019.<br><br>As Rahim suspected Ranjit Singh to be responsible for the letter, he also hatched a conspiracy to kill him.<br><br>In the murder case of Chhatrapati, local police had arrested two carpenters, Nirmal Singh and Kuldeep Singh, for the shooting and cited them on the FIR. The men allegedly worked at the Dera. Three months after Ram Chander Chhatrapati’s murder in January 2003, his son and successor as proprietor of the local newspaper, Anshul Chhatrapati, had petitioned the High Court for a CBI investigation into Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, which was accepted by the High Court nine months later in November.<br><br>The CBI filed a charge sheet against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Ram Rahim in July 2007. The evidence presentation concluded in November 2014, along with the related case involving the murder of Ranjit Singh. The primary accused, Nirmal Singh, was granted bail in January 2017, 14 years after his arrest. Kuldeep Singh, the other man on the motorcycle, had already been released on bail shortly after his arrest.

With each passing day, the market valuations are getting richer and they are now trading at levels which we have never seen before. Why are markets not correcting? The market seems Teflon coated!Markets are driven by three things – money flow, sentiments and fundamentals. In terms of money flow, today in India retail and HNI investors, domestic institutional investors led by mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds and foreign portfolio investors on an average are buyers. The only seller seems to be the promoters. <br><br>In terms of sentiment, the economy is opening up, growth rates are picking up and activity levels are above pre-pandemic level. <br><br>And in terms of fundamentals, corporate results have come reasonably strong.

So when there is a combination of three things, the market climbs the wall of worries.<br><br><br>Do you think it will continue to climb the wall of worry?Any market is defined by its ups and downs. Will there be corrections? Answer is yes. Will there be a crash? Unlikely to be unless one of the fundamental factors change. Corporate profitability from almost a 10-year decline has now started reversing. In FY21 corporate profitability grew despite GDP de-growth. FY22 is likely to see record corporate profitability growth and FY23 also seems to be on the same expectations. Economy is opening up as active cases have fallen below 2 lakh. The vaccination is likely to cross 100 crore and in terms of money flow with low interest rates prevailing there is money power, money flow coming into the market. So will there be corrections? Answer is undoubtedly yes. Is there likely to be a big crash like March 20? Most probably not.<br><br><br>Two very popular themes are EV and fintech. Are you convinced that these are multi-year themes which one should look into? Could EV and  right now be infra and power of 2008?On the electric vehicle side, is that the future? The answer is yes. There are compulsions of global warming and climate change, thanks to fossil fuel consumption. A newer technology will come which will help us contain climate changes and electric vehicles will be one technology to achieve that. <br><br>Now the second thing comes into play is related to valuation. We have recently seen in one of the large automobile players, private equities took a share at a reasonably good valuation much above the market value ascribed to their EV business. Such events will continue to shape market expectations about valuation. <br><br>Unlike the infrastructure theme where leverage and where execution became issues in 2008, in electric vehicles today, there are very few players. Governance seems to be reasonably solid and hence will there be delays, will there be governance related issues? Answer is unlikely to be no. The electric vehicle theme will be a long running theme.
