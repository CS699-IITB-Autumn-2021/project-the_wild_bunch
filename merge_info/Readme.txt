Run setup.sh:(This is the setup script)
	It makes a python virtual environment in a directory named virt_env and then install the required packages.
	Also a new directory assets/upload/article/ is made in the current folder, to store downloaded images. This is followed by change in permission of that directory
	Then open index.html and enter a keyword in the text box.
	Wait for few minutes. It will print a pretty table in html.
