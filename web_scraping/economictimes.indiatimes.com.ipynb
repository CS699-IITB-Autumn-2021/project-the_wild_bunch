       "'The Congress\\' Karnataka unit president D K Shivakumar said he will not blame anyone for the viral video in which former Lok Sabha member V S Ugrappa and media coordinator M A Saleem attributed him to an alleged scam when he was a Minister. \"People have already spoken whatever they wanted. I will not blame the BJP or the media. We only gave others a chance to use us,\" Shivakumar told reporters. <br><br>He was responding to the queries on the embarrassing video of the purported conversation between Saleem and Ugrappa on Tuesday ahead of a press meet at the party\\'s meeting hall. <br><br>In the video, Saleem is purportedly heard calling Shivakumar a \\'Collection Giraaki\\' (extortionist), who allegedly increased the \\'commission\\' in irrigation contracts from eight per cent to 12 per cent. <br><br>The party suspended Saleem from the party for six years and served a show-cause notice to Ugrappa, who is Congress spokesperson, seeking an explanation in three days. <br><br>The Congress state chief said the issue related to the viral video was not personal but pertained to a party, which was built by the lakhs of party workers. <br><br>Hitting back at the BJP for targeting him following the viral video, Shivakumar said let the BJP take note of what their leaders have spoken against their leader such as MLC A H Vishwanath, C P Yogeshwar, Ramesh Jarkiholi and Basanagouda Patil Yatnal.<br><br>\"Why the BJP has not yet answered to the charges levelled by Vishwanath, Yogeeshwar, Ramesh Jarkiholi and Yatnal (against former Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and his family)?
